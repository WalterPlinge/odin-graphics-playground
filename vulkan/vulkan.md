## General steps for setting up Vulkan

- Create a window (needs to support vulkan)
- Load initial vulkan functions
- Create instance using required extensions
- Load remaining vulkan functions
- (Optional) Set up debug helpers
- Create surface
- Select physical device and its queue families
- Create logical device and queues
- Create swapchain and image views (for the framebuffers)
- Create render pass state (for pipeline and framebuffers)
- Create pipeline. This involves state like:
	- Shaders
	- Vertex input
	- Assembly
	- Viewport
	- Rasteriser
	- Multisampling
	- Colour blending
- Create framebuffers for the render pass to use
- Create command pool and buffers for drawing
- (Optional) Set up semaphores and fences for syncronisation
- MAIN LOOP:
	- Wait for fences
	- Acquire next image
	- Submit commands to graphics queue
	- Present swapchain image
